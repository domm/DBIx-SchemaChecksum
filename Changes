0.27   2009-04-23 22:21:29
    - remove schema name from nextval: because this causes a lot of 
      trouble - THIS WILL BREAK YOUR OLD CHECKSUMS!! (Thomas Klausner)
    - added option --dump_checksums which automatically dumps all 
      checksum sources (Thomas Klausner)


0.26   2008-11-24 11:35:07
    - sort unique keys because sometimes PG reports them in a 
      different order


0.25   2008-11-10 19:01:37
    - added option to show update path without applying anything


0.24   2008-10-03 13:19:05
    - nicer output (say instead of croak)

      auto-updates


0.23   2008-09-26 17:01:44
    !!! BIG FAT WARNING !!!
    Older checksums won't work, at least for postgres
    !!! BIG FAT WARNING !!!
    - added postgres unique keys to checksum
    - include postgres enums in checksum
    - fixed another problem with SAME_CHECKSUM, skip files without 
      checksums

    - ignore files without a checksum
    - fixed more bugs with same-checksum updates


0.21  2008-09-19 16:34:04
    - find sql snippets in all dirs below the given dir
    - handle update scripts that result in the same checksum


0.20   2008-09-11 20:49:26
    !!! BIG FAT WARNING !!!
    Checksums calculated with version prior to 0.20 won't work with 
    checksums calculated after 0.20
    --- BIG FAT WARNING ---

    - changed schemadump to list columns sorted by name so that funky 
      postgres inheritance followed by changes to the table other 
      tables inherit from don't f*ck up the checksum.


0.10   2008-09-11 15:45:01
    - add command line option to ignore ORDINAL_POSITION of columns 
      

0.09   2008-09-11 11:56:08
    - ignore typed nextvals, which cause problems in postgres and 
      different connection methods (socket/tcp)


0.08 Thu Aug 21 09:48:23 CEST 2008
	- Make checksum, type schema unaware. This funnily posed problems when
	  connecting via socket or TCP to pg

0.07   2008-06-19 09:41:26
    - for strange reasons, MooseX::Getop does not work with DBI::db constraint
      when used from other scripts
      So I dumped the DBI::db constraint for now


0.06   2008-06-16 10:46:19
    - Test Coverage: 78.8%
    - removed IO::Prompt
